POTATODISEASEDETECTION

This project aims to detect potato diseases using deep learning techniques. The model is capable of categorizing potato plants into three classes: early blight, late blight, and healthy.

Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model was obtained from Kaggle. It consists of images of potato plants affected by early blight, late blight, and healthy potato plants.

Model Architecture

The deep learning model utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for image classification. The architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers to extract relevant features from the input images. The final layer uses softmax activation to classify the images into one of the three categories.

Requirements

Python 3.x

TensorFlow

Keras

Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test dataset
